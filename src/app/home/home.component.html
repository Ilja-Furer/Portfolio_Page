        Being a working student allows me to combine knowledge from both the classroom and the workplace. 
        This dual perspective enables me to explore topics from multiple anglesâ€”first as a student and then through a more practical, economical lens. 
        It helps me develop a holistic understanding of various subjects, allowing me to see beyond a simple black-and-white approach.

        In my profession, I am interested in exploring new and innovative ways of gathering and documenting requirements. 
        With my studies and major, I am also keen to integrate these approaches with organizational psychology, seeking methods to optimize outcomes for both myself and the company.
